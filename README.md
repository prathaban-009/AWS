# AWS
A real-world serverless web application built using AWS services to handle online registrations for International Yoga Day. This project leverages S3 (frontend hosting &amp; data storage), API Gateway, and Lambda (Python) to collect and store user data in a CSV file â€” all without any server management.

Recently, I have gained foundational knowledge in Amazon Web Services (AWS) through self-paced learning on platforms like Udemy and the AWS Learner Platform. Motivated by the certifications and concepts I acquired, I decided to apply my skills in a real-world scenario by building a practical cloud-based project.

This led me to design and implement a serverless architecture for Yoga Day Registration using key AWS services such as S3, API Gateway, Lambda, IAM, and more. Through this project, I have not only deepened my understanding of cloud concepts but also gained valuable hands-on experience in integrating services, managing permissions, and deploying scalable applications.

I view this as a starting point in my cloud computing journey and am excited to continue building more real-life projects. This experience has boosted my confidence, strengthened my practical skills, and reinforced my passion for learning and growing in the field of cloud technology.
